As a result, many finance teams in Southeast Asia (SEA) have gained a seat at the leadership table.\nHowever, only 34% of the respondents to a PwC and ACCA survey felt that the enhanced role that finance teams have played during the pandemic would last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We have seen finance teams step up to the challenge and gain greater respect, and a seat at the boardroom table.”\n\r\n\t\t      Charles LohDigital Transformation Leader, PwC Southeast Asia Consulting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree areas to address\nThere is an enormous opportunity for finance functions to strengthen its relevance and live up to the evolving demands and performance expected of them. They can increase the value of sustainability-based insights into strategic and operational decision-making and foster the right control mindset over these issues across the entire organisation. The three key areas to address are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData and technology\nRespondents in SEA have a relatively stronger expectation in pursuing its digital capabilities in comparison to their global counterparts. This is particularly so for the following digital capabilities:\n\n\nForward-based analytics (predictive and prescriptive)\n\nAdoption of automation and AI\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills and careers\nNearly 40% of respondents in SEA perceive mental health of the workforce to be a concerning lasting impact on the finance function.\n\nIn the short term, leaders need to address concerns surrounding the workplace of the future, and in the long term, adopt new ways of working.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovation and collaboration\nCreativity and innovation are the keys to success and both are only possible with collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWay forward\nHere are six key actions for finance functions to consider:\n\n\nRedefine the focus of finance to include broader performance metrics for natural and human capital.\nInvest in technologies that can be used to create an support an enterprise-wide data model.\n\nUse predictive analytics based upon this model to drive more holistic business decision-making.\n\nEnhance business partnering and analytical skills to ensure that finance can fulfil this new role across the organisation and continue to improve collaboration both across it and with external parties.\n\nDrive for greater efficiency, productivity and standardisation across processes and common platforms.\nThrough these actions, establish finance as the central point within the organisation for achieving sustainable and responsible growth and enhancing the reputation of the organisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Finance functions are confronting a new set of challenges amidst the pandemic. With the heightened focus on ESG, traditional views of profit maximisation no longer cut it. Investing in data and technology is the way forward. A rethink of skills and talent needs is in order, reinforced by a culture of innovation and collaboration.”\nRazman Adam ZainudinPartner, Finance Transformation, PwC Malaysia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the report\nIn the joint research conducted by PwC and ACCA, we draw insights from several interviews and virtual roundtables conducted in April 2021 and a survey of ACCA members and affiliates, PwC contacts, and various chief financial officers (CFOs) to delve into how the finance function in SEA has been impacted by COVID-19 and the factors that organisations must consider in order for their finance function to remain relevant.\nFind out more about the global insight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload\r\n                        Download the Malaysia infographics\r\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the SEA report to find out how finance functions can capitalise on the current opportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRazman Adam Zainudin\n\n\nPartner, Finance Transformation, PwC Malaysia\nTel: +60 (3) 2173 0225\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Email\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nToday's issues\nBudget\nTrust\nSustainability and Climate Change\nNew World.

Therefore, ensuring a fit-for-purpose finance function that meets the needs of an organization is crucially important. This tool is designed for use by boards and management teams to support meaningful discussion on how the finance function progresses within the organization. It also helps identify priority areas for further development that will maximize the value and contribution of the finance function.This tool is meant to be used alongside two other reports, which provide a vision for the CFO and finance function and future-fit roles for accountants in business.  View the report \"A Vision for the CFO & Finance Function\" View the report \"Future-Fit Accountants: Roles for the Next Decade\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload (3.42 MB)\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2024 The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).

FunctionFinancial PlanningLink to LearningElements of a Financial PlanForecasting and Budgeting\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\nDescribe the finance function.\nExplain the role of finance and its importance within an organization.\n\n\nThe Finance Function\nFinance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job responsibilities. The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a knowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting activities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts receivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and liability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for monitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the treasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for bankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring loan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also responsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the treasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller and treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that generates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital management, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of capital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting financial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and strategic planning.\nFinancial Planning\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit. Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners. These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store, partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning helps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\n\nIt uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements are created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income statements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\nCash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the timing and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations.\nBalance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most important aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5).\nForecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions are essential elements of financial planning.\nFinancial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are important aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been, how it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives.\n\nFigure 1.5: The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help to evaluate a firm.\n\n\nLink to Learning\n\n \nElements of a Financial Plan\nYou can view key elements in a financial plan at the US Small Business Administration’s website.\n\nForecasting and Budgeting\nForecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses, governmental agencies, not-for-profit firms, and individual households. As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are valuable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of cash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget well before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by developing financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the future. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its objectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and magnitude of expected cash flows.\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify the differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those changes. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is everything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and government. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps navigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and balance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives and serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to determine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The process should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a periodic renewal and reminder of the firm’s goals.\nFinancial forecasting often starts with the firm’s budget and recommends changes based on differences between the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in the immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\n\n\nThis page titled 1.3: The Role of Finance in an Organization is shared under a CC BY  4.0  license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by OpenStax via source content that was edited to the style and standards of the LibreTexts platform; a detailed edit history is available upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n1.2: What Is Finance?\n\n\n1.4: Importance of Data and Technology\n\n\n\n\nWas this article helpful?YesNo\nRecommended articles\n\n\n\n\n \nArticle type\nSection or Page\n\n\nAuthor\nOpenStax\n\n\nLicense\nCC BY\n\n\nLicense Version\n4.0\n\n\nOER program or Publisher\nOpenStax\n\n\nShow TOC\nno\n\n\n\nTags\n\n\n source@https://openstax.org/details/books/principles-finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Copyright 2024 Business LibreTexts\n\n   Powered by CXone Expert\n   ®\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LibreTexts libraries are Powered by NICE CXone Expert and are supported by the Department of Education Open Textbook Pilot Project, the UC Davis Office of the Provost, the UC Davis Library, the California State University Affordable Learning Solutions Program, and Merlot.

        "content": "Transforming to the finance function of the future | McKinsey\n\nSkip to main contentFinance 2030: Four imperatives for the next decadeNovember 17, 2020 | Article Ankur Agrawal Steven Eklund Josh Waite Ed WoodcockOver the past decade, finance departments reduced costs by almost 30 percent. The next decade’s focus: achieving even higher levels of effectiveness. (7 pages)\nThe trade-off between cost reduction and increased effectiveness of the finance function is a false choice. Leading finance departments are guardians of enterprise value creation, demonstrating stewardship of their own spend by lowering absolute costs and shifting work towards more value-added activities.\nWe have analyzed the finance functions of hundreds of companies to understand how cost and effectiveness have evolved over the past ten years. After controlling for differences in sector, scale, and geographic footprint, several findings emerged:\n\nFinance organizations have, on average, decreased their cost by 29 percent.\nThe most efficient cohort of finance departments (âfinance leadersâ) achieved similar cost improvement to the level shown by average performersâan impressive feat given that the finance leaders started from a lower cost base.\nFinance leaders spent 19 percent more time on value-added (versus transaction-processing) activities than a typical finance department did.\n\nWhat can companies do differently to join the finance leaders? The research points toward four imperatives. The first is to cast a wider net for new efficiency opportunities, reaching beyond the transactional activities that have long been the primary focus of attention. Second, boost financeâs role in managing data, whether consolidating, simplifying, or controlling the flood of information flowing across the organization. Third, strengthen decision-making through widespread adoption of data-visualization, advanced-analytics, and debiasing techniques. Finally, reimagine the finance operating model so that it fosters new skills and capabilities.\nThese steps are already enabling companies to join the finance-function eliteâwhile cutting audit costs by double-digit percentages, improving data quality (and reducing wasteful data-cleaning efforts), upskilling finance teams, and enabling the function to guide better decisions throughout the enterprise.\nA decade of efficiency gains\nWhile the magnitude of improvement varied among sectors, ranging from 15 to 35 percent over the ten-year period, the decline in the cost of finance departments is consistent across industries (Exhibit 1).\n 1\nMore significant, however, were the gains among the finance leaders, whose improvement rate was slightly higher (26 percent versus 25 percent) despite a leaner starting pointâdemonstrating the value of continuing to focus on finance-function efficiency regardless of previous gains. \nFinance leaders further differentiate themselves by spending a greater portion of their time on value-added activities, such as financial planning and analysis (FP&A), strategic planning, treasury, operational-risk management, and policy setting. Todayâs finance leaders spend 19 percent more of total finance-staff bandwidth on value-added activities than the average company did ten years ago (Exhibit 2). This prioritization enables finance leaders to build deeper capabilities in value-additive areas, creating a positive feedback loop that could result in even greater advantages in the future.\n 2\nThe finance department of the future\nAchieving the next frontier in finance efficiency and effectiveness will likely require finance executives to shift their thinking from the priorities of the past. Four moves are especially critical for delivering greater real-time insights, minimizing human error and biases, and driving speed in workflows and decision-making.\nImperative #1: Look beyond transactional activities\nMany leading organizations have substantially increased efficiency in transactional functionsâby 39 percent or moreâincluding areas such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, and other core accounting areas. While most companies have room for further improvement, subsequent efficiency efforts will almost inevitably show diminishing returns as the cost base for these activities continues to shrink.\nIn contrast, our research found fewer efficiency improvements in the more strategic areas of finance, such as FP&A, optimizing capital structures, tax planning, controllership, internal audit, and financial-risk management. This appears likely to change.\nWith advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly be applied to complex tasks, building on the lead started by robotic process automation (RPA) and similar technologies that are used to automate transactional activities. One high-tech manufacturer is now using machine-learning algorithms and analytics to monitor financial and business-continuity risks. These technologies have allowed audits to focus on the units that pose the greatest risks, and to reduce staff time needed to complete each audit. As a result, the manufacturer has reduced the total cost of internal audits by 15 to 20 percent.\nLikewise, a global consumer-package-goods company used natural-language generation (NLG) to provide an initial draft of the management discussion and analysis for its monthly operational review. This technology converts structured data into meaningful financial prose that summarizes and synthesizes insights. Automating portions of the reports freed up the time of highly skilled finance staff allowing them more time to resolve risks and pursue opportunities.\nWould you like to learn more about our Operations Practice?Visit our Service Operations page\nThe rise of big data has increased demand for workers with analytical skills, such as data scientists and machine-learning engineers. While demand continues to outpace supply, the pool of talent is increasing as a result of higher pay, upgrades in universitiesâ computer-science curricula, increased availability of free online AI resources, and private-sector investments in training.\nThese converging forces of advanced processes and a skilled work force are creating an environment to unlock efficiency in the value-adding areas of finance. To pursue this imperative, CFOs can:\n\nShift focus from low-end to high-end automation. Instead of focusing solely on mature, first-wave automation approaches such as RPA, a few leading companies are using machine learning and similar advanced technologies in âsecond-waveâ automation use cases in capital allocation, financial planning, and audit. The complexity of these technologies should not be underestimated, however. Several companies have stumbled in their use of AI. It is critical that CFOs overinvest in piloting these technologies to identify the right use cases, and be prepared to change direction if initial experiments fail.\nMake better use of staff time spent on value-added activities. Finance staffâs time is valuable, and best devoted to analyses that drive actual business performance. Leaders can help their teams by ensuring that requests for more information are grounded in a solid understanding of an agreed-upon set of drivers of business financial performance. CFOs can also set specific guidelines on where finance staff spend their time. For example, rather than performing reactive analyses of historical data to explain past performance, consider adopting a guideline that at least 80 percent of analyses focus on prescribing future courses of action.\nAlign with the wider enterprise on AI and machine-learning technologies. The technical landscape has changed over the past few years, with some platforms growing in popularity while others have lost users. Having an enterprise-wide strategy on which of the myriad technologies to employ not only allows more focused investments, it also encourages further collaboration between finance and other functions.\nEquip staff in critical roles with the necessary level of experience, leadership mind-sets, and authority to influence the business. While pursuing cost efficiency is a constant imperative, staff nevertheless need continual capability building if they are to successfully perform their roles as advisors and counterweights to senior executives in steering the financial trajectory of the business. Skills development is particularly important for those staff in senior FP&A and finance business-partnering roles, as discussed in more detail below under imperatives 3 and 4.\n\nImperative #2: Help finance lead in data\nThe size, complexity, and importance of data is growing at a record pace. The amount of data in the world is anticipated to reach 175 zettabytes (175 billion terabytes) by 2025, for an annual growth rate of approximately 66 percent over 2018 levels. The data that the finance department will use to create competitive advantages and remain compliant is no exception. The exponential growth poses a significant challenge for finance teams as they seek to distill ever larger and more complex data sets into a single source of truth that provides actionable information and insights to the rest of the organization.\nFinance departments need a clearly defined master data-management strategy to guide the collection, storage, and interrogation of the rising volume of data needed to perform the types of analytics the business requires. To support the businessâwhether through more nuanced financial-scenario planning, insight into how to better manage liquidity, or improved guidance on where to best deploy assetsâfinance must be able to quickly marshal high-quality, trusted data.\nOwing to its central role, the finance function is uniquely positioned to help define the master data strategy for the enterprise. As part of the functionâs responsibility to consolidate, simplify, and control company-wide data, finance leaders can:\n\nPrioritize data quality and consistency. The first step is setting high standards on data structure, entry, aggregation, storage, and protection across the company. CFOs can also take a larger role in driving enterprise-wide transformationâhistorically, less than half of CFOs have led those efforts. By steering the development of data governance and data operating-model decisions, CFOs can reinforce change-management practices not only within the finance organization, but also in adjacent functions that produce much of the data finance consumes.\nHelp lead data-standard alignment across departments. Although in many organizations the chief data officer is part of the IT function, the CFO has a unique perspective as both a major consumer and provider of consistent information across the company. Indeed, the CFO is often well-positioned to marshal resources across departments to address the topic of data standards and raise it to the top of the corporate agenda. While finance cannot drive enterprise data efforts alone, it can promote collaboration among the leaders of the IT, digital, customer-facing, and operational functionsâespecially by developing robust business cases that articulate quantifiable returns on investment for the associated improvements in data quality.\nInvest in an agile, tech-enabled data backbone. CFOs can advocate for adopting a layered architecture, with a common data layer that is flexible enough to accommodate changing business needs while preserving a single source of truth.\nAllocate finance-staff capacity to clean data. Investing finance-staff capacity to validate and clean data at the point of entry is far more efficient than addressing data-quality issues after they have occurred. In parallel, finance staff will likely need additional capabilities to understand the limitations of data and how to resolve them.\nDeploy technology for better-quality data. Data cleaning has always been essential but until recently it involved tedious and time-consuming manual work. Today, machine-learning algorithms can help cross-reference and validate data, which can reduce errors and the time needed to ensure data are correct when ingested.\n\nReimagine: Preparing for SG&A in the next normalRead the article\nImperative #3: Improve decision-making\nThe use of advanced analytical techniques to solve pressing business problems is increasingly a requirement for finance departments. Two years ago, our colleagues found that over half of the CFOs they surveyed wanted to use advanced analytics to improve the accuracy of cash-flow forecasts.\nThese sorts of efforts are gathering pace. A North American consumer-goods company, for example, is building a forecasting tool that will gather and analyze data including macroeconomic conditions, geographic factors, demographics, and other variables. Armed with this information, business leaders hope to be able to alter pricing decisions on the fly, as needed.\nBeyond providing analytical insights, the finance department is also responsible for framing discussions on company performance and the actions needed to improve it. To be effective, finance staff need to be able to provide:\n\nClearer insights, by communicating performance unambiguously, highlighting shortfalls against expected outcomes, as well as the underlying factors and context that informs why these gaps occurred.\nFaster insights, so that management can understand recent performance and make decisions to change its trajectory quickly and decisively.\nRicher insights, based on more robust datasets from a wider variety of sources, providing broader perspectives than those based only on internal financial data. For example, profit projections can be contextualized against the overall sectorâs performance. By basing insights on multifactor datasets that include both internal and external data sources, organizations gain a more realistic view of likely performance outcomes and reduce the chance that unexpected shocks will render projections inaccurate. Finance organizations that can simulate multiple scenarios are better equipped for black-swan events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTwo further actions can help improve insight generation and the decisions it informs. The first centers on training, particularly in analytical, data-visualization, and debiasing techniques and technologies. In industries where these tools are new, the potential competitive advantage they offer is highâbut so is the required commitment. Other sectors can provide inspiration on how best to upskill staff. For instance, a leading telecom player found that almost half of its back-office staff lacked the technical skills needed to achieve future goals, and 42 percent were in roles that were unlikely to exist in a decade. Rather than eliminate staff, the company encouraged employees to assess their own capability gaps and learn new skills. In its first year, the program enabled the company to fill 40 percent of new job openings with internal candidates.\nThe second action companies can take is to increase the quality and stature of senior finance business-partnering roles. The people in these positions need deep experience and perspective to drill into the causes of underperformance, and to push back against over-optimistic or unnecessarily conservative financial assumptions that may get baked into business plans. Matching true high performers to these critical roles is an essential component of translating analytic capabilities into realizable business outcomes.\nImperative #4: Reimagine the finance operating model with new capabilities\nFinance organizations are moving toward a new operating model that allows staff to adjust their work quickly and dynamically so they can focus on the most pressing topics facing their organization. This requires not only a different way of organizing how work gets done, but also a different type of finance professional.\nTo reduce the effort involved in operational tasks, the new finance operating model starts from a leaner core, with tighter data standards, new data-management practices, enhanced automation, and integration with a wide range of related digital technologies. Implementing this model involves a series of changes.\n\nBreak traditional hierarchies into flat networks of teams. The network model allows finance business partners to draw on a shared pool of analysts, who are assigned to specific work items based on well-defined and agreed-upon business priorities.\nMobilize temporary teams to deliver deeper insights into business problems. Creating this capacity follows agile working principles, such as instituting sprints to identify, design, and implement financial analyses that provide insights into business challenges.\nEmbed digital skills across the finance organization. These capabilities may include programing bot algorithms, using analytics software, or learning how to translate business data into actionable insights.\nDevelop a core of business-savvy finance leaders with the stature to engage company leaders as peers. Strengthening job rotations, both within finance and between finance and the business, builds a cadre of skilled professionals who can move easily throughout the organization. For rotations within finance, one automotive company requires executives to have worked in a minimum of two divisions, two finance functions, and two countries before ascending to senior roles. Another automotive company requires senior finance leaders to rotate through non-finance roles. In both cases the emphasis on building operational and leadershipâas well as technical financeâcapabilities is the important differentiating factor.\nBolster finance skills by developing a rigorous, transparent competency matrix. This detailed set of standards helps ground discussions about finance talent in objective criteria, and enables managers and individuals to choose among explicit capability-building actions to support career progression. For example, advanced practitioners in a given skillset may be required to spend at least ten percent of their time helping develop the skills of other staff.\nCreate formal and informal incentives for skill development. Examples include tying incentives to knowledge and capability development, setting explicit targets for internal promotions to finance leadership positions, and explicitly recognizing the accomplishments of managers who foster skill development by coaching their teams.\n\nThese steps came together recently at a global consumer-goods manufacturer developing a new performance-management system. The effort built a set of standard key performance indicators (KPIs) linked to the organizationâs overall value-creation roadmap and cascaded to each layer of the management structure. After harmonizing these measures across multiple business and geographic entities, the company then implemented a data lake to house all the metrics, populating the information in real time. In turn, the data lake supported real-time dashboards displaying KPI and financial-performance data from the general ledger, and allowed for drill-down capability. The initiative succeeded in reducing the time that the FP&A team spent on data capture, presentation, and manipulation by as much as 65 percent.\n\nAt the frontiers of effectiveness, finance leaders deliver far more than core financial skills: their work guides the functioning of the entire organization every day. Through four imperatives, the next-generation finance function can build the insights, performance, and planning capabilities leaders will need to support dynamic decision-making through the next decade.Ankur Agrawal is a partner in McKinsey’s New York office; Steven Eklund is a partner in the Stamford office, where Josh Waite is a consultant and Ed Woodcock is a senior expert.\nThe authors would like to thank Nikita Agarwal, Purna Choudhary, Tim Koller, Victoria Lee, Jorge Machado, Sahil Mehta, and Dhruv Sharma for their contributions to this article.Explore a career with usSearch OpeningsRelated ArticlesArticleReimagine: Preparing for SG&A in the next normalArticleThe future corporate center: Functional efficiency runs in the familySurveyHow COVID-19 has pushed companies over the technology tipping pointâand transformed business forever"
