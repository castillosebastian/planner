As a result, many finance teams in Southeast Asia (SEA) have gained a seat at the leadership table. However, only 34% of the respondents to a PwC and ACCA survey felt that the enhanced role that finance teams have played during the pandemic would last. We have seen finance teams step up to the challenge and gain greater respect, and a seat at the boardroom table. Charles LohDigital Transformation Leader, PwC Southeast Asia Consulting Three areas to address There is an enormous opportunity for finance functions to strengthen its relevance and live up to the evolving demands and performance expected of them. They can increase the value of sustainability-based insights into strategic and operational decision-making and foster the right control mindset over these issues across the entire organisation. The three key areas to address are: Data and technology Respondents in SEA have a relatively stronger expectation in pursuing its digital capabilities in comparison to their global counterparts. This is particularly so for the following digital capabilities: Forward-based analytics (predictive and prescriptive) Adoption of automation and AI Skills and careers Nearly 40% of respondents in SEA perceive mental health of the workforce to be a concerning lasting impact on the finance function. In the short term, leaders need to address concerns surrounding the workplace of the future, and in the long term, adopt new ways of working. Innovation and collaboration Creativity and innovation are the keys to success and both are only possible with collaboration. Way forward Here are six key actions for finance functions to consider: Redefine the focus of finance to include broader performance metrics for natural and human capital. Invest in technologies that can be used to create an support an enterprise-wide data model. Use predictive analytics based upon this model to drive more holistic business decision-making. Enhance business partnering and analytical skills to ensure that finance can fulfil this new role across the organisation and continue to improve collaboration both across it and with external parties. Drive for greater efficiency, productivity and standardisation across processes and common platforms.",

Through these actions, establish finance as the central point within the organisation for achieving sustainable and responsible growth and enhancing the reputation of the organisation. Finance functions are confronting a new set of challenges amidst the pandemic. With the heightened focus on ESG, traditional views of profit maximisation no longer cut it. Investing in data and technology is the way forward. A rethink of skills and talent needs is in order, reinforced by a culture of innovation and collaboration.

Explain the role of finance and its importance within an organization. The Finance Function Finance has many functions within an organization, and there are many job titles to reflect the varied job responsibilities. The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a knowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting activities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts receivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and liability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for monitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm. In most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the treasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for bankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring loan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also responsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the treasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public. The vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller and treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that generates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough. The chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a big picture position. The CFO sets policy for working capital management, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of capital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting financial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a hands-on manager and engages more in visionary and strategic planning. Financial Planning Financial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit. Financial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions required to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners. These could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a mom and pop store, partners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning helps managers understand the firms current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firms strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firms expansion. Good financial planning has a number of common features. It uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements.",
            "Financial planning helps managers understand the firms current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue objectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning process, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans typically consider the firms strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as the development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was thorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial banks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firms expansion. Good financial planning has a number of common features. It uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements are created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income statements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions. Cash flow statements are a critical part of any financial planning. Cash flow statements estimate the timing and magnitude of actual cash flows available to meet financial obligations. Balance sheets are critical for demonstrating the sources and uses of funds for a firm. One of the most important aspects of business is accounting (see Figure 1.5). Forecasting in the form of expected sales, cost of funds, and microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions are essential elements of financial planning. Financial analysis including ratio analysis, common-size financial statements, and trend statements are important aspects of financial planning. Such analysis aids in the understanding of where a firm has been, how it stacks up against the competition, and the assessment of target objectives. Figure 1.5: The Accounting System The accounting system relies on accurate data used to prepare all the financial reports that help to evaluate a firm.

Forecasting and Budgeting Forecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses, governmental agencies, not-for-profit firms, and individual households. As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are valuable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of cash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget well before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by developing financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the future. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its objectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and magnitude of expected cash flows. Financial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify the differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those changes. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that plans are worthless, but planning is everything. That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and government. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps navigate the inevitable detours toward the firms objectives. The budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and balance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives and serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to determine sources and uses of funds and required funding to meet department and firm objectives. The process should look to emulate successful processes and change or eliminate ineffective ones. Budgeting is a periodic renewal and reminder of the firms goals. Financial forecasting often starts with the firms budget and recommends changes based on differences between the budgeted financial statements and actual results. Forecasting adjusts management behavior in the immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.

            "Transforming to the finance function of the future | McKinsey Skip to main contentFinance 2030: Four imperatives for the next decadeNovember 17, 2020 | Article Ankur Agrawal Steven Eklund Josh Waite Ed WoodcockOver the past decade, finance departments reduced costs by almost 30 percent. The next decades focus: achieving even higher levels of effectiveness. (7 pages) The trade-off between cost reduction and increased effectiveness of the finance function is a false choice. Leading finance departments are guardians of enterprise value creation, demonstrating stewardship of their own spend by lowering absolute costs and shifting work towards more value-added activities. We have analyzed the finance functions of hundreds of companies to understand how cost and effectiveness have evolved over the past ten years. After controlling for differences in sector, scale, and geographic footprint, several findings emerged: Finance organizations have, on average, decreased their cost by 29 percent. The most efficient cohort of finance departments (finance leaders) achieved similar cost improvement to the level shown by average performersan impressive feat given that the finance leaders started from a lower cost base. Finance leaders spent 19 percent more time on value-added (versus transaction-processing) activities than a typical finance department did. What can companies do differently to join the finance leaders? The research points toward four imperatives. The first is to cast a wider net for new efficiency opportunities, reaching beyond the transactional activities that have long been the primary focus of attention. Second, boost finances role in managing data, whether consolidating, simplifying, or controlling the flood of information flowing across the organization. Third, strengthen decision-making through widespread adoption of data-visualization, advanced-analytics, and debiasing techniques. Finally, reimagine the finance operating model so that it fosters new skills and capabilities. These steps are already enabling companies to join the finance-function elitewhile cutting audit costs by double-digit percentages, improving data quality (and reducing wasteful data-cleaning efforts), upskilling finance teams, and enabling the function to guide better decisions throughout the enterprise. A decade of efficiency gains While the magnitude of improvement varied among sectors, ranging from 15 to 35 percent over the ten-year period, the decline in the cost of finance departments is consistent across industries (Exhibit 1). 1 More significant, however, were the gains among the finance leaders, whose improvement rate was slightly higher (26 percent versus 25 percent) despite a leaner starting pointdemonstrating the value of continuing to focus on finance-function efficiency regardless of previous gains. Finance leaders further differentiate themselves by spending a greater portion of their time on value-added activities, such as financial planning and analysis (FP&A), strategic planning, treasury, operational-risk management, and policy setting. Todays finance leaders spend 19 percent more of total finance-staff bandwidth on value-added activities than the average company did ten years ago (Exhibit 2). This prioritization enables finance leaders to build deeper capabilities in value-additive areas, creating a positive feedback loop that could result in even greater advantages in the future. 2 The finance department of the future Achieving the next frontier in finance efficiency and effectiveness will likely require finance executives to shift their thinking from the priorities of the past. Four moves are especially critical for delivering greater real-time insights, minimizing human error and biases, and driving speed in workflows and decision-making. Imperative #1: Look beyond transactional activities Many leading organizations have substantially increased efficiency in transactional functionsby 39 percent or moreincluding areas such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, and other core accounting areas. While most companies have room for further improvement, subsequent efficiency efforts will almost inevitably show diminishing returns as the cost base for these activities continues to shrink. In contrast, our research found fewer efficiency improvements in the more strategic areas of finance, such as FP&A, optimizing capital structures, tax planning, controllership, internal audit, and financial-risk management. This appears likely to change. With advances in computing power, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly be applied to complex tasks, building on the lead started by robotic process automation (RPA) and similar technologies that are used to automate transactional activities. One high-tech manufacturer is now using machine-learning algorithms and analytics to monitor financial and business-continuity risks. These technologies have allowed audits to focus on the units that pose the greatest risks, and to reduce staff time needed to complete each audit. As a result, the manufacturer has reduced the total cost of internal audits by 15 to 20 percent. Likewise, a global consumer-package-goods company used natural-language generation (NLG) to provide an initial draft of the management discussion and analysis for its monthly operational review.",

This technology converts structured data into meaningful financial prose that summarizes and synthesizes insights. Automating portions of the reports freed up the time of highly skilled finance staff allowing them more time to resolve risks and pursue opportunities. Would you like to learn more about our Operations Practice?Visit our Service Operations page The rise of big data has increased demand for workers with analytical skills, such as data scientists and machine-learning engineers. While demand continues to outpace supply, the pool of talent is increasing as a result of higher pay, upgrades in universities computer-science curricula, increased availability of free online AI resources, and private-sector investments in training. These converging forces of advanced processes and a skilled work force are creating an environment to unlock efficiency in the value-adding areas of finance. To pursue this imperative, CFOs can: Shift focus from low-end to high-end automation. Instead of focusing solely on mature, first-wave automation approaches such as RPA, a few leading companies are using machine learning and similar advanced technologies in second-wave automation use cases in capital allocation, financial planning, and audit. The complexity of these technologies should not be underestimated, however. Several companies have stumbled in their use of AI. It is critical that CFOs overinvest in piloting these technologies to identify the right use cases, and be prepared to change direction if initial experiments fail. Make better use of staff time spent on value-added activities. Finance staffs time is valuable, and best devoted to analyses that drive actual business performance. Leaders can help their teams by ensuring that requests for more information are grounded in a solid understanding of an agreed-upon set of drivers of business financial performance. CFOs can also set specific guidelines on where finance staff spend their time. For example, rather than performing reactive analyses of historical data to explain past performance, consider adopting a guideline that at least 80 percent of analyses focus on prescribing future courses of action. Align with the wider enterprise on AI and machine-learning technologies. The technical landscape has changed over the past few years, with some platforms growing in popularity while others have lost users. Having an enterprise-wide strategy on which of the myriad technologies to employ not only allows more focused investments, it also encourages further collaboration between finance and other functions. Equip staff in critical roles with the necessary level of experience, leadership mind-sets, and authority to influence the business. While pursuing cost efficiency is a constant imperative, staff nevertheless need continual capability building if they are to successfully perform their roles as advisors and counterweights to senior executives in steering the financial trajectory of the business. Skills development is particularly important for those staff in senior FP&A and finance business-partnering roles, as discussed in more detail below under imperatives 3 and 4. Imperative #2: Help finance lead in data The size, complexity, and importance of data is growing at a record pace. The amount of data in the world is anticipated to reach 175 zettabytes (175 billion terabytes) by 2025, for an annual growth rate of approximately 66 percent over 2018 levels. The data that the finance department will use to create competitive advantages and remain compliant is no exception. The exponential growth poses a significant challenge for finance teams as they seek to distill ever larger and more complex data sets into a single source of truth that provides actionable information and insights to the rest of the organization. Finance departments need a clearly defined master data-management strategy to guide the collection, storage, and interrogation of the rising volume of data needed to perform the types of analytics the business requires. To support the businesswhether through more nuanced financial-scenario planning, insight into how to better manage liquidity, or improved guidance on where to best deploy assetsfinance must be able to quickly marshal high-quality, trusted data. Owing to its central role, the finance function is uniquely positioned to help define the master data strategy for the enterprise.",

Owing to its central role, the finance function is uniquely positioned to help define the master data strategy for the enterprise. As part of the functions responsibility to consolidate, simplify, and control company-wide data, finance leaders can: Prioritize data quality and consistency. The first step is setting high standards on data structure, entry, aggregation, storage, and protection across the company. CFOs can also take a larger role in driving enterprise-wide transformationhistorically, less than half of CFOs have led those efforts. By steering the development of data governance and data operating-model decisions, CFOs can reinforce change-management practices not only within the finance organization, but also in adjacent functions that produce much of the data finance consumes. Help lead data-standard alignment across departments. Although in many organizations the chief data officer is part of the IT function, the CFO has a unique perspective as both a major consumer and provider of consistent information across the company. Indeed, the CFO is often well-positioned to marshal resources across departments to address the topic of data standards and raise it to the top of the corporate agenda. While finance cannot drive enterprise data efforts alone, it can promote collaboration among the leaders of the IT, digital, customer-facing, and operational functionsespecially by developing robust business cases that articulate quantifiable returns on investment for the associated improvements in data quality. Invest in an agile, tech-enabled data backbone. CFOs can advocate for adopting a layered architecture, with a common data layer that is flexible enough to accommodate changing business needs while preserving a single source of truth. Allocate finance-staff capacity to clean data. Investing finance-staff capacity to validate and clean data at the point of entry is far more efficient than addressing data-quality issues after they have occurred. In parallel, finance staff will likely need additional capabilities to understand the limitations of data and how to resolve them. Deploy technology for better-quality data. Data cleaning has always been essential but until recently it involved tedious and time-consuming manual work. Today, machine-learning algorithms can help cross-reference and validate data, which can reduce errors and the time needed to ensure data are correct when ingested. Reimagine: Preparing for SG&A in the next normalRead the article Imperative #3: Improve decision-making The use of advanced analytical techniques to solve pressing business problems is increasingly a requirement for finance departments. Two years ago, our colleagues found that over half of the CFOs they surveyed wanted to use advanced analytics to improve the accuracy of cash-flow forecasts. These sorts of efforts are gathering pace. A North American consumer-goods company, for example, is building a forecasting tool that will gather and analyze data including macroeconomic conditions, geographic factors, demographics, and other variables. Armed with this information, business leaders hope to be able to alter pricing decisions on the fly, as needed. Beyond providing analytical insights, the finance department is also responsible for framing discussions on company performance and the actions needed to improve it. To be effective, finance staff need to be able to provide: Clearer insights, by communicating performance unambiguously, highlighting shortfalls against expected outcomes, as well as the underlying factors and context that informs why these gaps occurred. Faster insights, so that management can understand recent performance and make decisions to change its trajectory quickly and decisively. Richer insights, based on more robust datasets from a wider variety of sources, providing broader perspectives than those based only on internal financial data. For example, profit projections can be contextualized against the overall sectors performance. By basing insights on multifactor datasets that include both internal and external data sources, organizations gain a more realistic view of likely performance outcomes and reduce the chance that unexpected shocks will render projections inaccurate. Finance organizations that can simulate multiple scenarios are better equipped for black-swan events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Two further actions can help improve insight generation and the decisions it informs. The first centers on training, particularly in analytical, data-visualization, and debiasing techniques and technologies.",

Two further actions can help improve insight generation and the decisions it informs. The first centers on training, particularly in analytical, data-visualization, and debiasing techniques and technologies. In industries where these tools are new, the potential competitive advantage they offer is highbut so is the required commitment. Other sectors can provide inspiration on how best to upskill staff. For instance, a leading telecom player found that almost half of its back-office staff lacked the technical skills needed to achieve future goals, and 42 percent were in roles that were unlikely to exist in a decade. Rather than eliminate staff, the company encouraged employees to assess their own capability gaps and learn new skills. In its first year, the program enabled the company to fill 40 percent of new job openings with internal candidates. The second action companies can take is to increase the quality and stature of senior finance business-partnering roles. The people in these positions need deep experience and perspective to drill into the causes of underperformance, and to push back against over-optimistic or unnecessarily conservative financial assumptions that may get baked into business plans. Matching true high performers to these critical roles is an essential component of translating analytic capabilities into realizable business outcomes. Imperative #4: Reimagine the finance operating model with new capabilities Finance organizations are moving toward a new operating model that allows staff to adjust their work quickly and dynamically so they can focus on the most pressing topics facing their organization. This requires not only a different way of organizing how work gets done, but also a different type of finance professional. To reduce the effort involved in operational tasks, the new finance operating model starts from a leaner core, with tighter data standards, new data-management practices, enhanced automation, and integration with a wide range of related digital technologies. Implementing this model involves a series of changes. Break traditional hierarchies into flat networks of teams. The network model allows finance business partners to draw on a shared pool of analysts, who are assigned to specific work items based on well-defined and agreed-upon business priorities. Mobilize temporary teams to deliver deeper insights into business problems. Creating this capacity follows agile working principles, such as instituting sprints to identify, design, and implement financial analyses that provide insights into business challenges. Embed digital skills across the finance organization. These capabilities may include programing bot algorithms, using analytics software, or learning how to translate business data into actionable insights. Develop a core of business-savvy finance leaders with the stature to engage company leaders as peers. Strengthening job rotations, both within finance and between finance and the business, builds a cadre of skilled professionals who can move easily throughout the organization. For rotations within finance, one automotive company requires executives to have worked in a minimum of two divisions, two finance functions, and two countries before ascending to senior roles. Another automotive company requires senior finance leaders to rotate through non-finance roles. In both cases the emphasis on building operational and leadershipas well as technical financecapabilities is the important differentiating factor. Bolster finance skills by developing a rigorous, transparent competency matrix. This detailed set of standards helps ground discussions about finance talent in objective criteria, and enables managers and individuals to choose among explicit capability-building actions to support career progression. For example, advanced practitioners in a given skillset may be required to spend at least ten percent of their time helping develop the skills of other staff. Create formal and informal incentives for skill development. Examples include tying incentives to knowledge and capability development, setting explicit targets for internal promotions to finance leadership positions, and explicitly recognizing the accomplishments of managers who foster skill development by coaching their teams. These steps came together recently at a global consumer-goods manufacturer developing a new performance-management system. The effort built a set of standard key performance indicators (KPIs) linked to the organizations overall value-creation roadmap and cascaded to each layer of the management structure. After harmonizing these measures across multiple business and geographic entities, the company then implemented a data lake to house all the metrics, populating the information in real time.",

After harmonizing these measures across multiple business and geographic entities, the company then implemented a data lake to house all the metrics, populating the information in real time. In turn, the data lake supported real-time dashboards displaying KPI and financial-performance data from the general ledger, and allowed for drill-down capability. The initiative succeeded in reducing the time that the FP&A team spent on data capture, presentation, and manipulation by as much as 65 percent. At the frontiers of effectiveness, finance leaders deliver far more than core financial skills: their work guides the functioning of the entire organization every day. Through four imperatives, the next-generation finance function can build the insights, performance, and planning capabilities leaders will need to support dynamic decision-making through the next decade.Ankur Agrawal is a partner in McKinseys New York office; Steven Eklund is a partner in the Stamford office, where Josh Waite is a consultant and Ed Woodcock is a senior expert.

To do so requires integrating human work and the digital ecosystem, taking on new responsibilities, and building advanced capabilities and new ways of working.Click here to learn more about how the finance function can evolve. This is the first in a series of articles on the future of the finance function.Finance functions face constant pressure to evolve in response to the ever-changing business environment. Although this evolution has no endpoint, forward-looking CFOs need to understand what a successful, value-adding finance function will look like in ten years.Drawing upon our experience and our exchanges with leading CFOs, we have developed a near-term vision for the future of finance. (See the exhibit.) As its overarching role, finance will become the custodian of performance. The function is uniquely positioned to steer enterprise-level performance, including providing guidance on how the organization allocates valuable resources. To fulfill this role, the finance function should change how it works and operates in four main ways. We believe that this vision not only serves as an inspiration, but also helps finance functions in setting clear targets for their near-term evolution.The Overarching Role: Custodian of Performance As business models become more complex, a company needs a custodian of performance to steer performance holistically and objectively in the best interest of the entire organization. This role extends beyond what academics and practitioners typically describe as performance managementsuch as forecasting, planning, budgeting, tracking KPIs, and reporting. We view these elements as only basic enablers for custodians to fulfill their role. To steer performance based on the corporate purpose, CFOs need to broaden their perspective beyond traditional financials, considering such issues as sustainability and societal impact. The custodian steers performance to achieve the companys purpose. Roche, for example, has articulated its corporate purpose as doing now what patients need next. Ideally, each decision entails making the optimal trade-off of resourcesamong business units, between business units and functions, and among functionsto fulfill this purpose. The custodian seeks to solve this multidimensional problem of resource allocation holistically. Although focusing on the corporate purpose increases the complexity of decision making, the payoff in terms of business impact is significant.To steer performance based on the corporate purpose, CFOs need to broaden their perspective beyond traditional financials. For example, sustainability and societal impact have become increasingly important considerations. CFOs can integrate these topicsoften referred to as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factorsinto performance steering. This extends well beyond the disclosure requirements and investor expectations that CFOs have typically considered in connection with ESG.The Four Enablers Four enablers support the finance function as the custodian of performance.Hybrid Finance FunctionIt is clear that digitization is fundamentally disrupting finance.",

This extends well beyond the disclosure requirements and investor expectations that CFOs have typically considered in connection with ESG.The Four Enablers Four enablers support the finance function as the custodian of performance.Hybrid Finance FunctionIt is clear that digitization is fundamentally disrupting finance. In their initial applications of digital, companies seek to reduce manual work by standardizing, optimizing, and almost fully automating their main finance processes from end to end. At the same time, they improve the availability and accessibility of data. Most companies have already embarked on this stage of the journey.After mastering the first stage, finance organizations should move toward hybrid financea symbiosis of finance specialists and the digital ecosystem that includes artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics. By integrating finance employees and digital capabilities, the finance function can use the digital ecosystem not only to promote efficiency, but also to perform value-adding tasks. In our view, every CFOs agenda should include evolving from efficiency-focused digitization to hybrid finance.Examples of how hybrid finance delivers value include:Providing initial hypotheses on the appropriate actions to take based on data-driven insights and pinpointing important questions to ask.Performing independent tasks (such as hedging) that do not entail repetitive work or clear rules.Conducting complex simulations relating to, for example, the interrelationships among cash, taxes, and the balance sheet. Hybrid finance also creates new roles in the finance function, as finance employees need to administer the digital ecosystem and perform sanity checks to ensure the quality of, for example, forecasts and simulations.Organization as a Living SystemThe finance function needs a fundamentally new operating model to support the custodian of performance. The end-to-end optimization and digitization of processes give rise to a networked organization that forms a living system. In this organization, the remaining manual tasks are fully transferred to global business services as well as to shared resources, such as automation experts, project managers, or business process owners. The boundaries between functions and business units further diminish. Work becomes functionally agnostic, less focused on specific deliverables, and performed more dynamically and iteratively. The end-to-end optimization and digitization of processes give rise to a networked organization that forms a living system. An effective and inclusive organization consists of three elements:Bundles of cross-functional support that pool data, tools, and systems to fully own end-to-end processes and their outcomes.Expert functions (such as tax, treasury, and HR) that support the cross-functional bundlesfor example, in discussing the options or legal restrictions that need be considered.Business partners that support the business leaders and other leaders (from the corporate level to local affiliates) by not only providing an appropriate answer, but also asking the right questions.Responsibilities Beyond Core TopicsThe networked organization makes it possible for the finance function to extend its responsibilities into adjacent topics previously managed by other support functions. This enhances the finance functions ability to steer performance holistically and promote optimal outcomes.Among the expanded responsibilities, we see four topics as especially important:Building a bridge to regulators and government authorities to actively optimize regulations and tariffs.Serving as an incubator of finance applications or supporting new business models with financial expertise.Taking an active role in co-creating a companys technology agenda, ensuring that business needs are addressed.Working with new types of stakeholders (such as kick-starter funding platforms) to develop new approaches to raising capital. Cryptocurrencies exemplify the opportunities relating to technology and innovative funding approaches. (See Finance Functions Should Lead Cryptocurrency Adoption.) Finance Functions Should Lead Cryptocurrency Adoption Cryptocurrencies, issued and maintained using blockchains, are fundamentally changing how we conduct business, pay for goods and services, and think about financing. Although cryptocurrencies have existed for years, the business and regulatory environments have only recently evolved to enable business models beyond financial speculation. Even central banks, which had been among the most vocal opponents, have started to consider using cryptocurrencies in their operating models.Finance functions should take the lead in managing their companies adoption of cryptocurrencies in new business models as well as in transactions along the value chain. Cryptocurrencies allow transactions and payments to occur simultaneously, eliminating the delays that are common today.",

Cryptocurrencies allow transactions and payments to occur simultaneously, eliminating the delays that are common today. In addition to speed and efficiency, companies can gain new financing options. Advanced CapabilitiesCareers and ways of collaboration should evolve and become more diverse to support the finance functions role as the custodian of performance as well as the other enablers. Every finance employee will need a differentiating expertisesuch as in a business domain, finance topic, or know-how relating to the intersection of business and finance or IT and finance. Finance employees will increasingly serve as the connection between technical analysis developers and results-oriented businesspeople, facilitating their interactions and translating their terminology.As a result, finance know-how will remain essential, and the ability to continuously improve technical and digital skills will gain importance, even as transactional tasks diminish or become automated. Analytics, mathematics, and technical skills will become commonplace, so that finance specialists can also serve as data scientists or developers of the digital ecosystem. For successful workers, self-driven learning will form the basis for personal evolution and impact.In this environment, career paths will become less predetermined and predictable. This means that every finance position can be a springboard to a more dynamic career. Local finance roles in country organizations will move closer to the business units, creating the need for a broader set of skills. Additionally, expectations for leadership skills will change, as enterprise-level thinking becomes the basis for setting priorities and determining optimal outcomes.The ways that employees collaborate should fundamentally change as well. Hierarchical departments and organizational silos should be replaced by purpose-driven finance teams. A strong mindset shift is required to lay the foundation for teams that are flexible and self-empowered while still being accountable. New remote setups open the way toward defining a unique, fit-for-purpose environment that balances remote work with proximity to the business units and enables people to perform certain roles from anywhere in the world. Finance functions must be able to continuously evolve in response to the dynamic business environment. In the near term, successful finance functions will become custodians of performance, applying the corporate purpose to holistically steer performance across the organization. To fulfill this role, it is essential to integrate human work and the digital ecosystem, as well as to develop a networked organization that allows the finance function to take on new responsibilities. Advanced capabilities and new ways of working are fundamental enablers of the transformation. Companies that embark on the journey to this vision will reap the rewards of stronger steering through whatever turbulence lies ahead.

Three steps guide the process of developing the ambitions:Finance leaders should first gain clarity on the need for change.This clarity provides the basis for developing a compelling story that promotes organizational support and facilitates defining an approach for driving change. The story should seamlessly flow from the companys overall purpose and vision.By clearly understanding its starting point and ambition for the future, a finance function can choose the right focus areas and initiatives.Drawing on our experience and examples from Roches finance transformation, we show how companies could implement these steps.

We see the finance function as a companys custodian of performancesteering activities and resource allocation at the enterprise level to achieve strategic objectives. In our view, many finance functions could fulfill such a role by the end of this decade.To ensure that they set the right direction for their function, finance leaders should first gain clarity on the need for change. This provides the basis for the next step: defining ambitions for the future, with a compelling strategic story that promotes organizational support and drives change.

Finance functions must help their companies address increasing regulations, such as those related to compliance and taxation, that add to the complexity of running the business. They must also support efforts to respond to capital market pressure and economic volatilityfor example, by identifying and contributing to cost savings goals. At the same time, the shortage of high-caliber talent is driving the need to develop a more attractive working environment. Last but not least, the sunsetting of legacy IT systems creates an opportunity to redesign processes in conjunction with installing new systems.Internal Factors. The need for greater efficiency and effectiveness to achieve a companys purpose and vision is a strong motivation to transform. In many finance functions, efficiency may lag because the current setup is fragmented and complex and leads to wasted effort. Often, a failure to realize benefits of scale causes finance-related costs to grow excessively as the companys sales increase. This reduces the financial flexibility needed to invest resources where needed. As to effectiveness, high-growth companies, in particular, want finance to provide support beyond its traditional roles of stewardship and scorekeeping. Many finance functions have significant room to improve as trusted advisers to the business, and they must advance even further to become its custodian of performance. Many finance functions must advance to become the companys custodian of performance. Corporate transactions provide another impetus for change. In the context of a post-merger integration, companies seek to streamline the finance organization to maximize synergies and realize the benefits of scale. Additionally, the finance function of startups and other companies preparing for an initial public offering needs to establish a new finance infrastructure to support the reporting and compliance requirements of a public company.Finally, many CFOs may be strongly motivated to transform their functions. For a new CFO, in particular, a finance transformation is an opportunity to gain transparency into current capabilities, as well as to create a legacy by taking the finance function on a transformation journey.Roche Emphasizes the Need for Agility For Roche, the main triggers are external business and technological disruptions. Three of Roches major brand-name biologic drugs are under competitive pressure from biosimilars, while technological advances are creating new opportunities across the value chain. To improve flexibility, the company is transforming from a traditional organizational model based on divisions and operational units to a more agile model. As people throughout the company seek to respond, they need the finance function to be more adaptable and focused on adding value. Accordingly, it is committed to experimenting with agile ways of working, encouraging its personnel to act as entrepreneurial spearheads and further leveraging its shared-services organization. A well-designed digital backbone (including an enterprise resource planning system) provides stability as the finance function increases flexibility and speed in this agile setup. Additionally, the finance function is analyzing and digitizing its processes end to end with the goal of reinvesting the savings generated in R&D.A Compelling Story and an Iterative Approach to Driving Change To truly transform their organization, finance leaders must first craft a compelling story that promotes support for the changes to come. They can then develop an approach to pursuing those changes, while being ready to adapt specific initiatives on the basis of internal and external developments. The finance functions story must be specific enough to guide decisions but easy for employees to internalize. Craft an inspiring and actionable story. The finance function needs a story that is specific enough to guide decisions but easy for employees to remember and internalize. Although striking this balance is challenging, it is essential to promoting the long-term support of the finance organization. The entire finance leadership team and organization, not only the CFO, must be fully committed to this story, which provides the foundation for the ensuing transformation.",

The finance function needs a story that is specific enough to guide decisions but easy for employees to remember and internalize. Although striking this balance is challenging, it is essential to promoting the long-term support of the finance organization. The entire finance leadership team and organization, not only the CFO, must be fully committed to this story, which provides the foundation for the ensuing transformation. The story must also make sense from a business perspective and align with the companys purpose, as CFOs typically need board approval for any investments in the transformation.The strategic story usually articulates messages covering three topics:The Finance Functions Contribution to the Companys Purpose. The entire finance organization, including internal and external stakeholders, should be inspired by the functions contribution, which sets the direction. The organization should recognize the contribution as appropriate and integrate its objectives into daily decision making.The Desired Future State of the Finance Function. The ambitions should be bold but realistic, as well as actionable and measurable.The Initiatives Needed to Achieve the Future State. The first set of initiatives should be based on a strong understanding of the path to the future state. Adaptability needs to be built in to allow for changes in the internal and external ecosystem, along with new knowledge gained along the way that creates clarity around the next steps.Together, these elements should constitute an easy-to-tell story that inspires the finance community and motivates action.Define an iterative approach. A well-thought-through approach to implementing the finance strategy begins with building momentum. To celebrate early successes and motivate employees, the organization can use pilot projects. To set the stage for wide-scale change, the finance community should prioritize early initiatives, taking into account that some might be pursued simultaneously. On the basis of the lessons learned, new initiatives can be identified that enable the company to take the next bold move. Members of the finance community should co-own and drive the changes to promote sustained impact. At the same time, colleagues across functions should work together to develop fit-for-purpose solutions or, at the very least, to test them. Early investment in enablers (people, technology, and data) will help to build the capabilities needed throughout the transformation.Roche Focuses on Explaining Why, What, and How Roches finance function is following a similar, iterative process to be well positioned for the future of finance. Although the details are unique to Roche, the companys approach demonstrates the value of thinking deeply about the future state, adopting an iterative approach to concrete initiatives, and considering potential implications. The approach results in three main elements: why, what, and howwhich are continuously refined when needed. (See Exhibit 1.) The first two elements are at the corporate level and apply companywide. Why is the companys purpose (Doing now what patients need next). What is reflected in the companys ten-year ambitions, which call for contributions from all parts of the business, and the vision for its Pharma and Diagnostics divisions. How is specific to finance and sets out the various ways that the function supports the company in achieving its purpose, ambitions, and divisional visions. It has four components:1. The finance framework consists of the contributions that every finance employee is expected to make:Connecting the dots as entrepreneursfor example, by designing and implementing initiatives from a comprehensive company perspectiveServing as a guardian for stakeholdersfor example, by safeguarding assets, providing transparency, and ensuring complianceProviding specialist expertisesuch as in accounting and taxationOwning processes and systems end to endsuch as by leveraging technology and automationThe extent of each employees contribution may vary by role.2. Shared mindsets, behaviors, and transferable skills aim to enable personal and professional development and flexible careers within and beyond the finance function.3. Finance ambitions include both quantitative and qualitative objectivesfor example: Analyzing end-to-end business processes across functions and aiming for a digitization ratio of 80% and Ensuring that finance personnel act as entrepreneurial spearheads, maintain an external focus, and take smart risks.4.",

Business priorities and strategies (parts of which may build on aspects outside of finance) are defined, and actions are identified to drive them.The Right Focus Areas and Initiatives The finance functions starting point strongly influences which initiatives will have the greatest impact and help to achieve its ambitions. For some finance functions, the bundling of transactional tasks or the automation of monthly reporting could constitute a step-change improvement. In contrast, mature functions could be ready for more ambitious initiatives, such as comprehensively revamping their activities and processes to promote greater business impact.BCGs CFO Excellence Index confirms that finance functions have a wide variety of starting points and improvement opportunities. Although the benchmarking finds relatively small performance differences among industries, we see significant differences between the best- and worst-performing finance functions in each industry. Top performers have highly efficient finance functions and focus on activities that create business impact. (See Exhibit 2.) These findings mean that there is no one-size-fits-all way to select the right initiatives. In our experience, successful finance transformations are comprehensive programs that encompass the functions operating model and value-adding processes, as well as enablers related to technology and ways of working. To identify initiatives, it is useful to answer the following questions:How does the finance functions setup need to change to achieve the future state? Issues to consider include the right mix of centralization and decentralization, the role of shared services and centers of excellence, the approach to partnering between finance and the business units, and the positioning and structure of the digital backbone.How can the finance function create more value? For example, it may need to redesign its processes to promote greater business impact, such as by integrating processes within and beyond the finance function to improve efficiency and effectiveness.What new capabilities does the finance function need to drive step-change improvements? Decision makers should consider data and technology as well as skills. To inform decisions, the function needs high-quality finance data that is easy to access and use.Transparency regarding each initiatives value creation potential and resource needs will help to promote open discussions about prioritization. Moreover, continuous communication is essential to ensure that teams are aligned in their pursuit of disruptive change. This will help in continuously challenging the as-is initiatives to ensure bold thinking. Otherwise, there is a strong risk of developing siloed solutions that cannot operate interactively. In the worst case, a function has initiatives that look good on paper but fail to realize the envisioned value.Roche Links Finance Initiatives to Its Strategy Roches finance function links its bold ideas closely to the components of its strategy. It has extended the scope of shared service centers beyond traditional end-to-end processes to include, for example, project management and elements of performance management. It also aims to digitize 80% of end-to-end business processes across functions and shared services, thereby eliminating many repetitive and time-consuming tasks. To establish and sustain the new ways of working, the finance function has systematically broken down silos, removed hierarchies, and eliminated non-mission-critical activities. Finance functions need to continuously evolve to keep pace with the changing business environment. A functions starting point provides the basis for determining the right level of ambition to promote disruptive change without overburdening the organization. By following the iterative approach we have outlined, CFOs can gain clarity and embark on a successful journey to the finance function of the future, building organizational knowledge and adaptive capabilities along the way.

September 22, 2022 By Alan Hippe, Bernhard Pellens, Alexander Roos, Anna Oberauer, and Petra Gall Finance functions must evolve to keep pace with the rapidly changing business environment. We previously presented hypotheses for what a successful, value-adding finance function will look like in ten years. To validate our hypotheses and understand the challenges to realizing the future vision, we surveyed corporate professionals and academics:Overall, the survey participants support our vision for the future.But they see only moderate progress toward achieving it, with planning for improvements still in the early stages.The findings suggest that there are valuable opportunities to share knowledge among industries and different-sized companies. Universities can support the effort by adapting academic curricula to evolving business requirements and providing practical know-how to professionals. Professionals and academics must do more to establish enabling relationships, technologies, ways of working, and competencies. This is the third in a series of articles on the future of the finance function.Finance functions must evolve to keep pace with the rapidly changing business environment. To meet the challenges, each function needs a unique vision that inspires employees to elevate their performance while enabling the organization to set clear targets for its near-term evolution. Although many finance functions recognize the need for a bold vision, few have made great strides in defining one and putting it into action. The survey participants support our vision for the future but see only moderate progresstoward achieving it. To help finance functions advance on this journey, we previously presented hypotheses for what a successful, value-adding finance function would look like in ten years. We then discussed how companies should think about evolving to ensure that they are well positioned going forward. To validate our hypotheses and understand the challenges to realizing the future vision, we surveyed corporate professionals and academics. (See About the Survey.) Overall, the survey participants support our vision for the future. But they see only moderate progress toward achieving it, and their planning for improvements remains in the early stages.

Professionals represent all organizational levels (from the supervisory board to low-level positions) and companies from a wide variety of industries. Approximately half the businesses have annual revenues exceeding 5 billion. For each hypothesis, we asked participants to indicate their level of agreement as well as to assess the current status of implementation and extent to which companies have developed action-oriented plans and initiatives. The survey findings point to the importance of understanding dependencies among the hypotheses. The results also suggest that there are valuable opportunities to share knowledge among industries and different-sized companies as organizations pursue finance function excellence.",

To support this transition to the future vision, universities should continually adapt academic curricula to the evolving business requirements and provide practical know-how to corporate professionals.A Vision for the Near-Term Future Our hypotheses for the finance functions near-term future are intended to serve not as a universal blueprint but as an inspiration and starting point for having the right discussions. We see the finance function as a companys custodian of performancesteering activities and resource allocation at the enterprise level to achieve strategic objectives. (See Exhibit 1.) To fulfill this role, CFOs need closer relationships with the CEO and supervisory board. Integrating human work and the digital ecosystem into a hybrid finance function is essential. The finance function also needs new ways of working in a networked organization, taking on responsibilities beyond its core topics and deploying new competencies. Since the publication of our previous articles, we have added change in CFO-CEO-supervisory board relationship as a sixth hypothesis to reflect the importance of these relationships in realizing the future vision.Support for the Vision, but Progress and Planning Lag Survey participants generally agreed with the bold vision for the future of the finance function reflected in the hypotheses. (See Exhibit 2.) Out of the six hypotheses, respondents assigned the highest importance to hybrid finance and the lowest to responsibilities beyond core finance topics. But participants reported only moderate progress in achieving the changes reflected in each hypothesis, with the greatest potential for improvement in hybrid finance and new competencies. Across all hypotheses, academics assessed the status quo to be less advanced than professionals didespecially with respect to becoming the custodian of performance.Most executives indicated that their company has formulated initial ideas for action-oriented goals related to each hypothesis but not a comprehensive transformation plan. They have made the least progress in developing plans for new competencies and responsibilities beyond core topics.Delving Deeper into Each Hypothesis A closer look at the findings reveals nuanced perspectives and discrepancies that highlight the changes required to realize the vision of the future.Custodian of Performance and Change in Relationships Participants embraced the concept of the custodian of performance. But they seem skeptical that CFOs relationships with their CEO and supervisory board will change significantly to enable this role to become a reality. (See Exhibit 3.) Consistent with the objectives of the custodians role, a vast majority of participants (89%) agreed that the finance function should take a holistic view in order to actively support the companys overall purpose. In line with this, they see the CFOs role as evolving from business partner to strategic partner and value driver. Today, the CFO typically serves as a sparring partner to the CEO on financial and business issues. In the future, respondents expect that the CFO will work strategically with the CEO and supervisory board on topics such as holistic resource allocation and will take on CEO-level issues and actively contribute to supervisory board discussions. But only 28% of participants strongly agreed that CFOs will become stronger drivers of future business decisions and have a fundamentally different relationship with the CEO. Similarly, only 28% strongly agreed that the CFOs new role will lead to greater involvement in important supervisory board decisions.Why do so many participants doubt that CFOs will become more active in driving enterprise-level decisions? One reason could be that only 22% of respondents believe that their finance function is aligned with the companys purpose and strategy. Moreover, despite embracing the custodian of performance role, only 64% of participants agreed that CFOs can or should solve the challenge of multidimensional resource allocation (such as among business units or between units and functions). Alignment and effective resource allocation are prerequisites for enabling CFOs to play a strong role in making and implementing business decisions.Hybrid Finance Function Participants strongly support the concept of hybrid finance.",

Alignment and effective resource allocation are prerequisites for enabling CFOs to play a strong role in making and implementing business decisions.Hybrid Finance Function Participants strongly support the concept of hybrid finance. Nearly all (99%) believe that the finance function must continuously anticipate the changes triggered by digitization and apply technology to increase its value contribution. Additionally, 88% agreed that these changes will cause job profiles to evolve, given that employees need to administer the digital ecosystem and ensure appropriate quality control. But the consensus was weaker regarding whether the functions value contribution will actually change. Only 39% of participants strongly agreed that hybrid finance will enable the function to perform a greater share of highly value-adding activities.Networked Function, Responsibilities Beyond Core Topics, and New Competencies These three hypotheses are interrelated. The finance function must define how its organization will operate and the topics it will focus on going forward. It can then identify the new competencies needed to realize this vision.Participants agreed that the finance function needs new ways of working in a networked organization to keep up with changes in how finance experts collaborate within the function, with other functions, and with external stakeholders. Many respondents believe that less hierarchical methods of collaboration will offer a significant advantage when competing for talent. Survey respondents agreed that the responsibilities of the finance function are moving beyond its core topics. Respondents also agreed that the responsibilities of the finance function are moving beyond its core topics. Two-thirds (68%) believe that the finance function will take on additional responsibilities, including helping to shape the companys technology agenda and using finance expertise to enable new business models. Participants see environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics as increasingly important: 82% agreed that the finance function will play a leading role in the development and implementation of ESG strategies (for example, KPIs, resource allocation, risk management, and governance models).Participants views on new competencies are in line with this expansion of responsibilities95% agreed that, while finance know-how will continue to be essential, the ability to continually improve technical and digital skills will gain importance.Perspectives by Company Size and Industry and from Academia Participants views of the hypotheses, as well as the current state and progress of improvement ideas, varied across company sizes as well as industries and differed between the corporate sphere and academia.For instance, businesses with revenues of less than 5 billion were slightly less enthusiastic in their support for the hypotheses, appear to be less advanced today, and have fewer specific improvement ideas.Respondents from the industrial goods and health care industries had the most positive views about the hypotheses. Participants who work in industrial goods, banking, and consumer goods and services reported being least advanced with respect to current status and formulating improvement ideas.Compared with corporate professionals, respondents from academia expressed less support for the hypotheses and judged the status of the finance function to be less advanced. This may reflect a tendency for academics to be more critical, aiming at a more comprehensive and proven framework to deliver the future.Recommended Actions Participants responses reveal disparities between the status quo and the vision of the future, as well as a scarcity of already proven approaches for concrete actions. Given these findings, we propose ways for businesses and academia to close the gaps.For Businesses Corporate professionals need to adopt an enterprise mindset, recognize the interrelated nature of the hypotheses, and participate in knowledge-sharing opportunities. The hypotheses are intended to provide inspiration as they discuss action-oriented solutions and define clear goals for their future work.Focus on the corporate purpose. Aligning the finance strategy as closely as possible with the companys purpose is essential to ensure that professionals maintain an enterprise mindset and make decisions that are in line with the companys overarching direction. Ideally, each decision entails making the optimal tradeoff of resourcesamong business units, between business units and functions, and among functions. To steer performance on the basis of the corporate purpose, professionals need to broaden their perspective beyond traditional financials. For example, sustainability and societal impact have become increasingly important considerations.Understand your ambition and the dependencies. To derive appropriate steps for implementing the finance function of the future, professionals need a strong understanding of the options.",

For example, sustainability and societal impact have become increasingly important considerations.Understand your ambition and the dependencies. To derive appropriate steps for implementing the finance function of the future, professionals need a strong understanding of the options. Initiatives to realize the vision must consider how closely the different aspects intersect and the dependencies for successful implementation. For example, to be a custodian of performance, the CFO must participate in decision making with the CEO and board, and to expand the finance functions responsibilities, the organization needs new competencies.Gain exposure to new ideas and initiate concrete actions. The survey results highlight that companies have reached different stages in evolving toward the future of the finance function. Some have made progress in all aspects, while others have focused on a specific area, such as digitization. A companys industry (and the related regulations), ownership structure, and size play a role in determining how and where the finance function evolves. Even so, professionals can benefit from learning how their counterparts at other organizations are seeking to improve their finance function.There are many ways to initiate knowledge sharing among finance functionsin both direct interactions and forums such as conferences and roundtables. Even companies that are strongly advanced in realizing the future of the finance function can benefit, as there is doubtless further room for improvement in specific subtopics. Each function should prioritize the opportunities to address its blind spots and come away from the knowledge-sharing sessions with concrete improvement actions.For Academia Academics can support corporate professionals by refreshing their curricula and providing practical know-how. Closer interaction between academics and business practitioners will be essential. Update the academic curricula. The survey results indicate that companies need help from academia in understanding how to achieve their ambitions. Universities should refocus academic work to meet the new challenges of transitioning to the finance function of the future. Curricula must be flexible enough to support the ongoing development of the finance function without neglecting finance fundamentals. Closer interaction between academics and business practitioners will be essential. To enhance the relationship, universities can provide additional case study seminars in collaboration with companies. This setup ensures that students learn how to apply their knowledge in a real-world setting. It can also be helpful for academics and practitioners to become involved in associations, such as Schmalenbach-Gesellschaft fr Betriebswirtschaft e.V., that provide an institutionalized framework for the exchange between business administration theory and practice. As an applied science, business administration needs to be compared with the reality of entrepreneurial activity in order to continually identify and explore relevant issues and critically question its knowledge and database. The real challenges of rapid change can only be identified and tackled jointly by academics and practitioners.Provide actionable, interdisciplinary support. Although the topics and challenges are clear, companies seem to lack the know-how to solve their specific problems and implement solutions. To help professionals succeed in their ambitions, academics can propose new processes and support the development of new competencies, especially relating to major topics of academic research (for example, finance, IT, and sustainability). Given the expanding roles of professionals, interdisciplinary programs are needed.To enable an interdisciplinary approach, universities can provide new modules that combine IT, sustainability, and finance topics and show how they are interlinked. From an accounting perspective, such a module could contain information about the proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) or the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards from the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and link this sustainability information to financial accounting. Another example might be a module that introduces software or programming languages, such as Python, and applies them in a finance setting. Each company will have its own journey to realizing the future of the finance function, depending on its specific starting point and ambitions. Our study reveals common gaps and discrepancies, however. Many participants share the goal of transforming the finance function into the custodian of performance. But they must do more to establish the enabling relationships, technologies, ways of working, and competencies. Success requires rigorous planning by companies and support from universities to meet the challenges.
